# TV Explorer

## Description

This application is a full-stack TV discovery and tracking platform built in Nuxt, providing features including: advanced search/filtering, detailed show pages, personalized favorites and watchlists, and interactive data visualizations of show rating metrics.

This project originated from a personal passion for television and a desire to gain in-depth insights into TV shows and discover my next bingewatch. I found that existing platforms tend to focus on movies, and that there are a lack of platforms specifically dedicated to television - this project felt suitable to address both my personal needs and that market gap. In addition to solving that, this project enabled me to expand my tech stack by learning new frameworks in Vue.js and Nuxt.js.
